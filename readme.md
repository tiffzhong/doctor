Finding "Similar" doctors to me means ratings, specializations, gender, and/or location.

I approached this project using Javascript. I utilized drop down menus for users to specify their doctor's specifications. Since there are many specializations that doctors can do, I used BetterDoctor's API to generate the a specialization list for the drop down list. Then I used the user's selection of specification into the doctor search API.

If I were given more time, I would make the location search a lot more specific to user's city location, not only their state. I would also improve on providing more details about the doctors qualifications, insurance providers, education, etc. For the specialty drop down, I would sort the list alphabetically, or change the query to a doctor's practice instead. This would make the list a lot shorter and easier to find a user's needs.
